Hi, everyone this is my first blog post. I used `Jekyll`, a _simple static site generator_(in other words it eases the task of writing the plain text to html) to create this blog, and thanks to `github`! which let's one host and create pages of personal projects or personal blog in the world wide web. 

Looking forward to update this blog on a daily basis! The brain child of this blog is **GSoC '21**, but I hope it's not the end and I keep on writing, as it helps document things and you can manage things better and also people tend to forget quite a lot of things over the years, so maintaing a blog also helps one with this problem as you may go back to your blog posts, and there! you already recollected the old stuffs!!

PS: Quite a long paragraph without a full-stop. Also hope to communicate better.

Cheers!
