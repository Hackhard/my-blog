## The Genius Polymath


> Being a role model is the most powerful form of educating.
>                                -John Wooden.

The above quote indeed is true apart from being one of the most OG quotes I've heard. No wonder it comes from one of my best role models of my life : Nikola Tesla

As said by the great Freud, *you think the way you're being taught by your closest kin* and that's what happened with me. Right from my childhood days I've been taught lessons about Nikola Tesla by my parents and I being a curious kid wanted to know more and more and learnt a lot of good things about <Insert Naame> which also made a connection in a quite different manner, not to mention as to the reasons of him being my role model.

Nikola Tesla, one of the best and unsung inventors the world has ever seen was a Serbian-American polymath who pioneered Alternating Current. He was known for his imagination and creativity and could think of a prototype without even making it; such was the genius' ability to imagine.Training for an engineering career, he attended the Technical University at Graz, Austria, and the University of Prague. At Graz he first saw the Gramme dynamo, which operated as a generator and, when reversed, became an electric motor, and he conceived a way to use alternating current to advantage. Later, at Budapest, he visualized the principle of the rotating magnetic field and developed plans for an induction motor that would become his first step toward the successful utilization of alternating current, and thereby making his own induction motor. His idea of a polyphase system of  alternating current, dynamos and motors won against the titanic battle of Edison's direct current.

In order to allay fears of alternating currents, Tesla gave exhibitions in his laboratory in which he lit lamps by allowing electricity to flow through his body. He was often invited to lecture at home and abroad. The Tesla coil is still a widely used product today in radio and television sets and other electronic equipment. One of the most amazing feats of Tesla is he proved Earth can be used as a conductor and can be made to resonate at a certain electrical frequency. He also lit 200 lamps without wires from a distance of 40 km and created man-made lightning, producing flashes measuring 41 meters.

These are the qualities that make a genius like him, my role model as he's the one I want to follow and be one, maybe someday!?

Thanks!!
