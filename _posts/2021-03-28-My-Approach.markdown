Hi everybody,

After a bit of trial and errors on certain websites known to block the exit relays of Tor(reddit) found some interesting stuffs, that I didn't know of.

You could see [the comment](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/community/support/-/issues/40013#note_2728858). Basically it lists my findings about reddit, it shows that one can access https://reddit.com using Tor, by logging in, tho one cannot remain annonymous after logging in, as the website knows the profile and get's quite some information, and that doesn't remain anonymous browsing anymore.
Though there are alternatives like: [old reddit](https://old.reddit.com) and [reddit ssl](https://ssl.reddit.com) that doesn't require logging in and one can browse annonymously.
But other websites like [instagram](https://instagram.com) one needs to login in, to view the content. 

Websites like [Google](https://google.com) loads without any restrictions, but searching up something, like maybe "Tor" [Google Search Tor](https://www.google.com/search?q=tor) returns Captcha.
